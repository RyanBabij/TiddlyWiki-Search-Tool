# TiddlyWiki Search Tool
An external search tool for TiddlyWiki to supplement the terrible built-in one.

Developed with Python 3.10.6. Required BeautifulSoup.

Developed with GPT4. Actually I didn't write any of it, hopefully it works okay lol.

You must modify the source to link to your index.html file. When you open the program it will prompt you for a keyword to search.

It will display the title of each article, and below it will display each line containing the keyword.

Sample output:
